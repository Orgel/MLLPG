With this program, the lighting and other effects for a model railway can be easily created and managed. Up to 256 RGB LEDs or 768 individual LEDs can be managed.

The desired functions can be selected and configured via an easy-to-use user interface. A variety of commands are available. The most important one is certainly the “living house”. But you can also select Andrew's crosses, signals, traffic lights, sounds, servos and much more with just one click.

The effects can be started automatically or activated via a central unit. The following protocols / buses are currently supported: DCC, Selectrix and the Märklin CAN bus.
